Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".

We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need minimal Spring configuration.

If youâ€™re looking for information about a specific version, or instructions about how to upgrade from an earlier release, check out [the project release notes section](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki#release-notes) on our wiki.
